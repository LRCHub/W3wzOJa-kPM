Walk right on in
Stretch out your arms
Let the love light shine on my soul
And let love come running in
You know that I've needed you
I've needed you a long long time
My pride is too much for me baby
And I'm about to lose my mind

Walk right on in
Let your love come running in
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your heart
And let love come running in
Let your love come running in

Let it flow like the river
Let it shine like the light
Take all my blind soul baby
Why don't you give it sight

I've tried to keep from loving you
But I've been loving you a little too long
Darling darling you've been so sweet to me
That's what keeps my love so strong

Walk right on in
Let your love come running in
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your heart
Open the door to your heart
And let love come running in
Let your love come running in

Let it flow like the river
Let it shine like th elight
Take all my blind soul baby
Why don't you give it sight
