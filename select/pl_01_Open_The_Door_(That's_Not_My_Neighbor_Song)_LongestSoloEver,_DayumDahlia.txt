Good afternoon,
hello, hi
Isn't it nice to be human?
(Entirely human)
It would be so kind
if you could open the door
and let me inside
You're askin'
a whole lot of questions
Is it the way
that I'm dressed or
Is it the number of eyes?
I knew it was something,
I'll come back
with a new disguise
Take another face
and make it mine
Making a replacement
of your kind
I'm another feature creature
next in line
(Don't look behind you)
Oh, you saw right through me,
didn't you?
Your senses are screaming,
"This isn't a human!"
Well, I'm getting better
and sooner or later,
you'll open the door
See my name on the list?
(Right)
Everything checks out?
(Let me inside)
Gonna make a little call?
(Why?)
There's nobody—
(Hello?)
Fuck
I really need
to get into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
I really need
to get into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
Hey there, hi
Have you ever thought
of quitting?
Sorry about that,
let's just start
from the beginning
Here's my card and my form
Why was I outside the building?
Oh yeah,
I was at my job making a killing
It's kinda silly
to focus all on my voice
and shape
Call me the tenant from heaven,
'cause I'm a patron saint
I've been so nice and so kind
to my neighbors
Now if you could do me
this one damn favor My,
you've got
a lot of questions
but I guess I won't mind
I'm kind of in a rush
and it's a waste of time
To ask me things over
and over to see if I slip up
Just open the door first
I just think that
we should reach out
with a helping hand
Doppelgangers all around,
why all the reprimand?
Nowadays,
everybody running while
they still can
Meanwhile,
I'm working harder
than the milkman
See my name on the list?
(Right)
Everything checks out?
(Let me inside)
Gonna make a little call?
(Why?)
There's nobody—
(Hello?)
Fuck
I really need to get
into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
I really need to get
into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
There's danger at your doorstep
And only you can prevent
what's in store!
Now, to identify an impostor
All you have to do—
(Hoon!)
Fuck that
I'ma switch up the visage,
a mission to trip up the vision
Cognition is slipping
every time
I get a little closer to winning
You're starting to doubt
the shape of my mouth
I'll figure you out,
I'll get another face
and come back around
I'm endless,
another couple tries,
you'll be defenseless
Falling for my lies,
can't comprehend this
So call for backup,
I'll come back
You let me in,
watch the bodies stack up
See my name on the list?
(Right)
Everything checks out?
(Let me inside)
Wait, we're good?
Really?
Hahahahaha, finally!
Fuck!
I really need to get
into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
I really need to get
into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
I really need to get
into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
(Don't wanna wait anymore)
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
(If you could open the door)
I really need to get
into the building
Don't wanna wait anymore
(Don't wanna wait anymore)
Everyone out here is dying
to get in, so
If you could open the door
